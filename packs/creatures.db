Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"human","schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-10-07T12:12:15.184+01:00","version":{"schema":0.791,"foundry":"10.287","system":"4.2.3"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal"},"ownership":{"default":0,"9g8lmLMlp6k3bR8B":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"x65g4zam3crf4ubv","name":"Hunter's Edge","type":"feat","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/choice-feature.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.mzkkj9LEWjJPBhaq"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":[{"id":"94b44dd7duck9edt"}]}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have trained for countless hours to become a skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an additional benefit when you Hunt Prey depending on the focus of your training.

Your proficiency ranks for simple, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all such weapons and unarmed attacks when attacking your hunted prey.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>When you move through natural terrains, you are difficult to track. You always gain the benefits of the Cover Tracks action in such terrains, without moving at half your Speed.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons' breath, and worse.

Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Nature's Edge<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You always find the weak points in your foes' defenses when they're on unfavorable terrain. Enemies are flat-footed to you if they're in natural difficult terrain or in difficult terrain resulting from a snare.</p>\n<h2>Ranger Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced your techniques to make them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your ranger class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Wild Stride<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You move quickly through obstacles, whether they're tumbled stone, tangled undergrowth, or sucking mud. You can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. As normal for ignoring difficult terrain, this also lets you treat the hindrances of greater difficult terrain as those of difficult terrain.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Masterful Hunter<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your abilities as a hunter to incredible levels. Your proficiency rank for your ranger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon that you have master proficiency in, you can ignore the penalty if attacking your hunted prey within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>\n<p>If you have master proficiency in Perception, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you Seek your prey, and if you have master proficiency in Survival, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you Track your prey. You also gain an additional benefit depending on your hunter's edge.</p>\n<p>See specific hunter's edges for more information.</p>\n<h2>Second Skin<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your armor has become akin to a second skin for you. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master. When wearing light or medium armor, you can rest normally, rather than receiving poor rest that leaves you fatigued.</p>\n<h2>Swift Prey<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You size up your prey with only a glance.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Human Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Two free ability boosts</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it’s positive).

Every conversation is an investigation, after all, and you never know what you might uncover!</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You look for clues in your environment. You often prove yourself to be a valuable ally by serving as a party scout, analyzing the intricacies of puzzles or mysterious phenomena, and pursuing leads that could reveal beneficial information.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime</h2>\n<p>You study up on subjects new and old, make new allies you can share information with, and pursue hobbies that keep your active mind satisfied. You might make a bit of coin on the side working as a private detective or consulting with the local constabulary.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start asking questions-including several that are quite involved-immediately after you're presented with a conundrum.</li>\n<li>Strive to uncover the deeper meanings behind anything you encounter and to identify the social machinations that truly drive events behind the scenes.</li>\n<li>Get so involved in a case that you ignore other matters, deeming them trivial.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find the cascades of information you spout forth extremely helpful, if difficult to fully comprehend.</li>\n<li>Get a bit annoyed that you're such a know-it-all.</li>\n<li>Rely on you to solve mysteries, puzzles, or other challenges requiring intellectual curiosity and reasoning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>On the Case</h2>\n<p>As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one reaction you can use to investigate cases: @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.xTK2zsWFyxSJvYbX]{Pursue a Lead} and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.25WDi1cVUrW92sUj]{Clue In}.</p>\n<h2>Devise a Strategem</h2>\n<p>You can play out a battle in your head, using brains rather than brawn to execute an attack.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.m0f2B7G9eaaTmhFL]{Devise a Strategem}</p>\n<h2>Methodology</h2>\n<p>Your studies have made you savvy in many areas,; but one in particular drew your intense interest.</p>\n<p>Choose a methodology. The methodologies presented in this book are as follow:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ln2Y1a4SxlU9sizX]{Alchemical Sciences Methodology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.g3mNzNphtVxyR9Xr]{Empiricism Methology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.O3IX7rTxXWWvDVM3]{Forensic Medicine Methodology}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.UIHUNNYZyQ3p4Vmo]{Interrogation Methodology}</p>\n<h2>Investigator Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an investigator class feat.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Strike</h2>\n<p>When you strike carefully and with forethought, you deal a telling blow. When making a Strike that adds your Intelligence modifier on your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.</p>\n<p>As your investigator level increases, so too does the deadliness of your strategic strike. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Keen Recollection <span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You can recall pertinent facts on topics that aren't your specialty. Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks to Recall Knowledge is equal to your level instead of +0.</p>\n<h2>Skillful Lessons<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every odd-numbered level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for an Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill, or for the skill you gained from your methodology.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank in Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Great Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Investigator Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've refined your investigative techniques to an exceptional degree. Your circumstance bonus from Pursue a Lead increases to +2. Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Deductive Improvisation<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You use your skills at deduction to perform whatever task is necessary to solve the case. You can attempt any check that requires you to be trained in a skill, even if you're untrained in it; you can attempt any check that requires you to have expert proficiency in a skill so long as you're trained in it; and you can attempt any check that requires you to have master proficiency in a skill as long as you have expert proficiency in it.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things that are almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor.

Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Master Detective<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>As a master detective, you can solve any case and find all the clues available. If you're pursuing the subject of a lead and you enter a new location that includes another clue toward solving the mystery, the GM informs you of the existence of the clue and its type: an object, person, spell effect, or the like. When you find the clue, the GM informs you that you've done so. If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM chooses one to inform you about. When you find any of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that you've done so, even if it wasn't the clue they'd chosen or there are other clues you haven't found. Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to master.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Advanced Player's

While some see them as dour and humorless crafters of stone and metal, dwarves and those who have spent time among them understand their unbridled zeal for their work, caring far more about quality than quantity. To a stranger, they can seem untrusting and clannish, but to their friends and family, they are warm and caring, their halls filled with the sounds of laughter and hammers hitting anvils.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dwarves are slow to trust those outside their kin, but this wariness is not without reason. Dwarves have a long history of forced exile from ancestral holds and struggles against the depredations of savage foes, especially giants, goblinoids, orcs, and the horrors that dwell deep below the surface. While trust from a dwarf is hard-won, once gained it is as strong as iron.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is as hard as nails, a stubborn and unrelenting adventurer, with a mix of rugged toughness and deep wisdom—or at least dogged conviction—you should play a dwarf.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to uphold your personal honor, no matter the situation.</li>\n<li>Appreciate quality craftsmanship in all forms and insist upon it for all your gear.</li>\n<li>Don't waver or back down once you've set your mind to something.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as stubborn, though whether they see this as an asset or a detriment changes from one person to the next.</li>\n<li>Assume you are an expert in matters related to stonework, mining, precious metals, and gems.</li>\n<li>Recognize the deep connection you have with your family, heritage, and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Dwarves are short and stocky, standing about a foot shorter than most humans. They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of masculinity and honor among the dwarves, and thus a clean-shaven male dwarf is considered weak, untrustworthy, or worse.</p>\n<p>Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming of age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can live to around 350 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The ancient surface empire the dwarves once ruled fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies. Today's dwarves retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends.</p>\n<p>While the distance between their mountain Sky Citadels can create vast cultural divides between various dwarf clans, most dwarven societies share a number of similarities. Nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and gem-cutting. Most are highly skilled at architecture and mining, and many share a hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids.</p>\n<p>Few dwarves are seen without their clan dagger strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a dwarf's birth and bears the gemstone of their clan. A parent uses this dagger to cut the infant's umbilical cord, making it the first weapon to taste their blood.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Dwarves tend to value honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. They have a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often very particular about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harder— especially when strong ale is involved.</p>\n<p>The typical dwarf is lawful good or lawful neutral and prefers to worship deities of those alignments. Torag, god of dwarvenkind, is the dwarves' primary deity, though worship of Torag's family members is also common.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Dwarven adventurers tend to work as treasure hunters or sellswords. They often leave their citadels and subterranean cities in search of wealth to enrich their homeland or to reclaim long-lost dwarven treasures or lands taken by the enemies of their kin.</p>\n<p>Typical dwarven backgrounds include acolyte, artisan, merchant, miner, and warrior. Dwarves excel at many of the martial classes, such as barbarian, fighter, monk, and ranger, but they also make excellent clerics and druids.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Dwarves honor their children with names taken from ancestors or dwarven heroes, and it's quite rare to invent a new name or to borrow a name from another culture for a child. When introducing themselves, dwarves tend to list their family and clan, plus any number of other familial connections and honorifics.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"human","schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-10-07T12:12:15.283+01:00","version":{"schema":0.791,"foundry":"10.287","system":"4.2.3"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal"},"ownership":{"default":0,"wWqm3VdXJHibulPg":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"krofq42pxoxgr0ax","name":"Martial Disciple (Athletics)","type":"background","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.backgrounds.faHydq29Q4RP5CAK"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You dedicated yourself to intense training and rigorous study to become a great warrior.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WILXkjU5Yq3yw10r]{Counter Performance}</em> composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.</p>\n<h3><strong>Composition Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.IAjvwqgiDr3qGYxY]{Inspire Courage}</em> composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Muses</h2>\n<p>As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.</p>\n<p>Muses can be found here: @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.YMBsi4bndRAk5CX4]{Maestro}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.y0jGimYdMGDJWrEq]{Polymath}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.4ripp6EfdVpS0d60]{Enigma}, and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.N03BtRvjX9TeHRa4]{Warrior}.</p>\n<h2>Occult Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don't need a spell component pouch or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-6: Bard Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up -- this is usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The magnum opus class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3-6), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Bard Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Great Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Bard Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and whip. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered the occult. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your command of occult magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Magnum Opus<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using bard spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core

You gain the Attack of Opportunity reaction.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.O2MwufzEHbuThoGr]{Attack of Opportunity (Fighter)} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span></p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a fighter class feat.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Bravery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Having faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and keep on fighting. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you roll a success at a Will save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, anytime you gain the frightened condition, reduce its value by 1.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Hours spent training with your preferred weapons, learning and developing new combat techniques, have made you particularly effective with your weapons of choice. Choose one weapon group. Your proficiency rank increases to master with the simple and martial weapons in that group, and to expert with the advanced weapons in that group. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have master proficiency.</p>\n<h2>Battlefield Surveyor<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Whether taking stock of an enemy army or simply standing guard, you excel at observing your foes. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks for initiative, making you faster to react during combat.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Combat Flexibility<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Through your experience in battle, you can prepare your tactics to suit different situations. When you make your daily preparations, you gain one fighter feat of 8th level or lower that you don't already have. You can use that feat until your next daily preparations. You must meet all of the feat's other prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have spent so much time wearing armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency rank for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced your techniques to make them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your fighter class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned fighting techniques that apply to all armaments, and you've developed unparalleled skill with your favorite weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master. Your proficiency rank for advanced weapons increases to expert. You can select one weapon group and increase your proficiency ranks to legendary for all simple and martial weapons in that weapon group, and to master for all advanced weapons in that weapon group.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Improved Flexibility<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your extensive experience gives you even greater ability to adapt to each day's challenges. When you use combat flexibility, you can gain two fighter feats instead of one. While the first feat must still be 8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and you can use the first feat to meet the prerequisites of the second feat. You must meet all of the feats' prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with armor improves, increasing your ability to prevent blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You are nigh-unmatched with any weapon. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to legendary, and your proficiency rank for advanced weapons increases to master. Your proficiency rank for your fighter class DC increases to master.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"fighter","schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-10-07T12:12:15.268+01:00","version":{"schema":0.791,"foundry":"10.287","system":"4.2.3"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"0c3e5":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-legend.webp","level":13,"name":"Weapon Legend","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.F5VenhIQMDkeGvmV"},"2jey6":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/fighter-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Fighter Expertise","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.bAaI7h937Nr3g93U"},"9c5ay":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/armor-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Armor Expertise","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.x5jaCJxsmD5sx3KB"},"e1e4m":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/shield-block.webp","level":1,"name":"Shield Block","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.eZNCckLzbH3GyncH"},"enizk":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-flexibility.webp","level":15,"name":"Improved Flexibility","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.W2rwudMNcAxs8VoX"},"ij943":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/battlefield-surveyor.webp","level":7,"name":"Battlefield Surveyor","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.TIvzBALymvb56L79"},"lakjk":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bravery.webp","level":3,"name":"Bravery","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.GJKJafDGuX4BeAeN"},"lphi1":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","level":9,"name":"Juggernaut","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.OMZs5y16jZRW9KQK"},"q0xyz":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/armor-mastery.webp","level":17,"name":"Armor Mastery","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.CGB1TczFhQhdQxml"},"r6269":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/attack-of-opportunity.webp","level":1,"name":"Attack of Opportunity","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.hmShTfPOcTaKgbf4"},"r6jbx":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","level":15,"name":"Evasion","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.MV6XIuAgN9uSA0Da"},"txlgu":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/combat-flexibility.webp","level":9,"name":"Combat Flexibility","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.8g6HzARbhfcgilP8"},"u1d1r":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":7,"name":"Weapon Specialization","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt"},"u8k07":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/fighter-weapon-mastery.webp","level":5,"name":"Fighter Weapon Mastery","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.gApJtAdNb9ST4Ms9"},"vis8d":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","level":15,"name":"Greater Weapon Specialization (Level 15)","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Z7HX6TeFsaup7Dx9"},"x98c2":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/versatile-legend.webp","level":19,"name":"Versatile Legend","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.0H2LxtiZTJ275pSD"}},"hp":10,"trainedSkills":{"value":[],"additional":3},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":2,"martial":2,"advanced":1,"unarmed":2,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":1},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]},"abilityBoostLevels":{"value":[5,10,15,20]}},"ownership":{"default":0,"1ngJgIJit6FlHOOz":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"c690km52zmgjxl0g","name":"Attack of Opportunity","type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.KAVf7AmRnbCAHrkT"},"pf2e":{"grantedBy":{"id":"qi2y6v720lrshw8u"}}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"human","schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-10-07T12:12:15.190+01:00","version":{"schema":0.791,"foundry":"10.287","system":"4.2.3"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal"},"ownership":{"default":0,"9g8lmLMlp6k3bR8B":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"cjhz4lrmj65zgfxg","name":"Rogue's Racket","type":"feat","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/choice-feature.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.uGuCGQvUmioFV2Bd"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":[{"id":"b2j3bs4zo5tf0iqn"}]}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities.

When you use Debilitating Strike, you can apply two debilitations simultaneously; removing one removes both.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Slippery Mind<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You play mental games and employ cognitive tricks to throw off mind-altering effects.
